# Language Filtering Feature

## Overview
The snippet manager now supports filtering snippets by programming language. This allows users to quickly find code snippets in specific languages.

## Features

### Language Assignment
- When creating or editing a snippet, you can specify the programming language
- Languages are stored as simple text strings
- Examples: "JavaScript", "Python", "CSS", "TypeScript", "React"

### Displaying Languages
- Languages are displayed as blue badges on snippet cards and detail pages
- Language badges appear in both compact and full snippet card views
- Languages are prominently displayed in snippet detail pages

### Filtering by Language
- On the snippets list page, a dropdown filter allows you to select a specific language
- Only snippets with the selected language will be displayed
- A "Clear filter" button allows you to show all snippets again
- Clicking on any language badge in a snippet card will automatically filter by that language

### User Experience
- The filter dropdown only appears when there are languages available
- Empty state messages are contextual - showing different messages for no snippets vs no filtered results
- Language filtering is performed client-side for fast response times
- Clickable language badges provide intuitive filtering interaction

## Database Schema
The `snippets` table includes a `language` column of type `text` to store the programming language.

## Technical Implementation
- Languages are stored as simple text strings for flexibility
- Frontend filtering is implemented using React state management
- Language extraction automatically finds all unique languages from existing snippets
- Clickable language badges provide intuitive filtering interaction
- Filter state is managed locally for responsive user experience
